# OOP-244-NGG
This subject introduces the student to object-oriented programming. The student learns to build reusable objects, encapsulate data and logic within a class, inherit one class from another and implement polymorphism.  This subject uses the C++ programming language exclusively and establishes a foundation for learning system analysis and design and more advanced concepts as implemented in languages such as C++, Java, C# and Objective-C.

## Workshop 1: Compiling Modules

In this workshop, I learned:
* organize source code into modules, using header and implementation
files
* compile and link modular programs
* distinguish the contents of a header and an implementation file

## Workshop 2: Dynamic Memory

In this workshop, I learned:
* allocate and deallocate dynamic memory for an array
* allocate and deallocate dynamic memory for a single variable
* incorporate dynamic memory along with user input
* overload functions
* create and use references

## Workshop 3: Classes and Privacy

In this workshop, I learned:
* to define a class type
* to privatize data within the class type
* to instantiate an object of class type
* to access data within an object of class type through public member functions
* to use standard library facilities to format data inserted into the output stream

## Workshop 4: Constructors

In this workshop, I learned:
* code a class for simple objects
* define a constructor that sets an object to a safe empty state
* overload a constructor to receive information from a client

## Workshop 5: Operator Overload

In this workshop, I learned:
* code a compositional relationship across multiple classes
* manage dynamic memory within a class
* overload an operator as a member of a class
* overload an operator as a helper function of a class
