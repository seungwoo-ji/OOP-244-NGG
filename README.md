# OOP-244-NGG
This subject introduces the student to object-oriented programming. The student learns to build reusable objects, encapsulate data and logic within a class, inherit one class from another and implement polymorphism.  This subject uses the C++ programming language exclusively and establishes a foundation for learning system analysis and design and more advanced concepts as implemented in languages such as C++, Java, C# and Objective-C.

## Workshop 1: Compiling Modules

In this workshop, I learned:
* organize source code into modules, using header and implementation
files;
* compile and link modular programs;
* distinguish the contents of a header and an implementation file;

## Workshop 2: Dynamic Memory

In this workshop, I learned:
* allocate and deallocate dynamic memory for an array;
* allocate and deallocate dynamic memory for a single variable;
* incorporate dynamic memory along with user input;
* overload functions;
* create and use references;
