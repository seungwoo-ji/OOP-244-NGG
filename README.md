# OOP-244-NGG
This subject introduces the student to object-oriented programming. The student learns to build reusable objects, encapsulate data and logic within a class, inherit one class from another and implement polymorphism.  This subject uses the C++ programming language exclusively and establishes a foundation for learning system analysis and design and more advanced concepts as implemented in languages such as C++, Java, C# and Objective-C.

## Workshop 1: Compiling Modules

In this workshop, I learned:
* organize source code into modules, using header and implementation
files
* compile and link modular programs
* distinguish the contents of a header and an implementation file

## Workshop 2: Dynamic Memory

In this workshop, I learned:
* allocate and deallocate dynamic memory for an array
* allocate and deallocate dynamic memory for a single variable
* incorporate dynamic memory along with user input
* overload functions
* create and use references

## Workshop 3: Classes and Privacy

In this workshop, I learned:
* to define a class type
* to privatize data within the class type
* to instantiate an object of class type
* to access data within an object of class type through public member functions
* to use standard library facilities to format data inserted into the output stream

## Workshop 4: Constructors

In this workshop, I learned:
* code a class for simple objects
* define a constructor that sets an object to a safe empty state
* overload a constructor to receive information from a client

## Workshop 5: Operator Overload

In this workshop, I learned:
* code a compositional relationship across multiple classes
* manage dynamic memory within a class
* overload an operator as a member of a class
* overload an operator as a helper function of a class

## Workshop 6: Class with a Resource


In this workshop, I learned:
* To implement a copy constructor and copy assignment operator
* To manage a class with dynamic resources
* To use existing objects to create new ones or to assign values to existing objects based on other existing ones.
* To implement custom input/output operators.

## Workshop 7: Derived Classes & Custom I/O Operators


In this workshop, I learned:
* Inherit a derived class from a base class
* Shadow a base class member function with a derived class member function
* Access a shadowed member function that is defined in a base class
* Utilize custom input/output operators with these classes

## Workshop 8: Virtual Functions


In this workshop, I learned:
* define a pure virtual function
* code an abstract base class
* implement behavior declared in a pure virtual function

## Workshop 9: Templates


In this workshop, I learned:
* To code a templated class
* To specify the type to implement in a call to a templated class
* To specify a constant numeric parameter to a templated class

## Milestone Project: Seneca Valet Application

the project is to create an application that keeps track of a Valet Parking that can park Cars, Motorcycles and Busses in a parking and retrieve them back when requested.
